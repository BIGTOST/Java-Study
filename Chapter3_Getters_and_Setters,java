             *  In this Person class, there is a single variable: name. This variable can be accessed using the gatName() method and
             *  changed using the setName(String) method, however setting a name requires the new name to have a length
             *  greather than 2 and to not be null. Using a setter method rather than making the variable name public 
             *  allows others to set the value of name with certain restrictions. The same can be applied to the getter method:
             *  public String getName(){
             *      if(name.length()>16)
             *      {

             *      }
             *  }
             *
             *  In the modified getName() method above, the name is returnid only if its length is less than or equal to 16.
             *  Otherwise, "Name is too large!" is returned. This allows the programmer to create variables that are reachable
             *  and modifiable however they wish, preventing client classes from editing the variables unwantedly
             *

        /*
         *
         *  We can't access the count variable because it's privat. But we can access the getCount() and the setCount(int)
         *  methods because they are public. To some, this might raise the question; why introduce the middleman? Why not
         *  just simply make the count public?
         *
         *  public class CountHolder{
         *      public int count = 0;
         *  }
         *
         *  For all intents and purposes, these two are exactly the same, functionality-wise. The difference between them is the 
         *  extensibility. Consider what each
         *
         *      First: "I have a  method that will give you an int value, and a method that will set that value to another int"
         *      Second: "I have an int that you can set and gets as you please"
         *
         *  These might sound similar, but the firsst is actually much more guarded in it nature; it only lets you interact with its 
         *  internal nature as it dictates. This leaves  the ball in its court; it gets to choose how internal interactions occurs. The
         *  Second has exposed its internal implemnetation externally, and is now not only prone to external users, but, in the case of 
         *  an API, committed to maintaining that implementation (or otherwise releasing a non-backwards compatible API).
         *
         *  Lets consider if we want to synchronize access to modifying and accessing the count. In the first, this is simple:
         *
         *  public class CountHolder(){
         *      private int count = 0;
         *
         *      public synchronized int getCount() {
         *          return count;
         *      }
         * 
         *      public synchronized void setCount( int num){
         *          count = num;
         *      }
         *
         * }
         *
         *  But int the second example, this is now nearly impossible without foing and modifying each place where 
         *  the count variables is referenced. Worse still, if this is an item that you're providing in a library to be consumed by
         *  others, you do not have a way of performing that modification, and are forced to make hard choice, mentioned above
