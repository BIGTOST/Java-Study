//? Anatomy of Java
/*
  * Funtions in java - small building block
  * A Block of code that performs a task

  * functions start with the type of data who are returning
 * return tipe ->     void
 * name of function -> firstFunction
 * void firstFunction() {
 *  here's go the code
 * }
 *
 * Similar of c# leva as chavetas porem devem iniciar na mesma linha do nome da função igual a javaScript
 * Every java dev must atleast haveone function the main
 *
 *void main(){
 *
 * }
 *
*/

/*
 * Class -> Class is a container with one or more related function
 * every java must atleast have one class who the name is main
 * classes are defined be the "Class" key word,
 * The name in this case is Main
 * and the curlbraker
 *
 * class Main{
 *      void main(){
 *
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * funtiona in beetwen of the class curlbraces belongs to the class, and
 * funtions who belong to a class are called method, so main is a method of the class main, and functions who arn't
 * related are just called funtions
*/

/*
 * Access Modifier
 * similar to the enclauser tag in the C# public private etc
 *
 * so the basic strincture of a java project is
 *
 * public class Main{
 *      public void main(){
 *
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * In java is used diferent conventions to name things
 *
 * To Classes -> PascalNamingConvention -> Every first letter of every word must be uppercase
 * To Methods -> camelNamingConventon ->  The first letter of every word, except for the first word, are UpperCase
